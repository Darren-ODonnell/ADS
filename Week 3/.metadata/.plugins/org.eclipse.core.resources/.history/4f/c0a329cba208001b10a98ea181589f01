/* This class is a definition of a new entity that I'm calling Pair. This will allow me to 
 * create a Pair of anything that have the same type. So I could ultimately have a pair of students, 
 * a pair of grades, a pair of shoes or in the case that you'll be using today, a pair of strings and then later
 * a pair of points (where a point is defined by an x and a y coordinate).
 * 
 * Note that this class is in its own package. 
 * A package is simply a folder and using packages allows me organise my classes 
 * into folders so similar classes reside in common folders. */
